## The Summary of Career Sol #1:

---

### 1. How can we build stronger connections with our professional network?  
**Question:** How do we strengthen ties with our current network or new contacts?  
**Answer (Marco):** Step out of your comfort zone and engage authentically. Instead of submitting resumes to automated systems (ATS), call or email recruiters directly. Be fully present—e.g., no phone distractions during talks.  

---

### 2. What criteria should we use to choose people for networking?  
**Question:** How do we identify good connections for expanding our network?  
**Answer:** There’s no fixed rule since you don’t know their personality upfront. Look for people who aren’t lazy and keep pushing. Marco says, “My best colleagues made mistakes but never stopped trying.” These are the ones who open doors.

### 3. How do we introduce ourselves to new connections?  
**Question:** For those outside the UK aiming for its market or elsewhere, what should they do?  
**Answer:** Showcase yourself with a portfolio. For developers, put code on GitHub; for project managers, create a slide of your projects. Key tip: Tailor your approach (short or detailed) to the other person’s style.

### 4. Should we be modest when pitching ourselves?  
**Question:** In resumes or interviews, should we downplay or highlight our skills?  
**Answer:** Be yourself—don’t fake it. Marco suggests sitting quietly with a pen and paper to list your achievements. He did this during the pandemic, covering his wall with Post-its to map his past and future.

---

### 5. What should we consider when setting goals?  
**Question:** How do we set achievable goals that keep us motivated?  
**Answer:** Goals should be ambitious and personal, not just “reasonable.” Marco says, “I don’t believe in sensible goals—aim for the best; even 50% of that is good.” Example: If you love problem-solving, chase work that excites you every morning.

---

### 6. What if we don’t know what we like?  
**Question:** If we’re unsure of our passion, what do we do?  
**Answer:** Pick one path and dive deep—zigzagging wastes time. Marco shares, “I wanted to be a pianist, then tried engineering and loved it. Choose something and stick with it.”

---

### 7. How can we identify and leverage market demand?  
**Question:** How do we spot market needs to find better jobs?  
**Answer:** Check reports from McKinsey or Gartner, but don’t over-rely on them. Marco says, “I worked at an AI startup in London because I enjoyed it, not just market trends.” Follow your passion and keep applying.

---

### 8. Advice for a backend developer struggling to find work?  
**Question (Mohammad):** I’m a backend dev, but companies want full-stack, and competition’s tough. Suggestions?  
**Answer:** Be the best at your craft and build a strong portfolio. Big firms like Sky need tons of backend devs, while startups prefer full-stack. Show your value—e.g., share projects on GitHub that profit businesses.

---

### 9. How important are project management certifications?  
**Question:** For starting in project management, how vital are certifications, and which ones matter?  
**Answer:** They’re useful—PMP or Google PM shift your thinking, even if companies don’t fully use them. Marco says, “I’ve never seen PMP fully applied, but it helped me.” Pick the industry standard and learn from it.

---

### 10. With economic downturn and AI layoffs, what’s smart for a backend dev?  
**Question (Ali):** Should I deepen skills like PHP or pivot to a product role with AI?  
**Answer:** Do both if you like—focus on what you enjoy. Learn PHP, contribute to GitHub, or build a personal site. Marco warns, “Don’t overanalyze—just act. Analysis paralysis is laziness.”

---

### 11. What’s unique about British work culture?  
**Question (Dmitry):** Moving to the UK as a senior PM—what’s the work culture like?  
**Answer:** Precision and clarity matter. Marco says, “Brits are cold, but it’s an asset. Polish your CV, improve your English, adapt to their ways—like eating at your desk instead of long lunches.”

---

### 12. Should we target specific companies or take the first good offer?  
**Question (Losechukwu):** Does the company we work for shape our career path early on?  
**Answer:** It depends on you. Marco says, “I didn’t plan—just solved problems and got invited. Others target top firms and thrive.” Be true to yourself, work hard, and go with the flow.

---

### Wrap-Up:  
Marco stresses passion, persistence, and visibility (e.g., GitHub, strong CVs). His pandemic Post-it wall or late-night lab work led to unexpected opportunities. Challenge yourself with action and learning, not just planning!
