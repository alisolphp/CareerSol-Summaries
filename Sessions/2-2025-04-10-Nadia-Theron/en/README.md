### Introduction to Nadia Theron and Her Background
- **Who is Nadia Theron?**  
  - AI and tech consultant with over 12 years of entrepreneurial experience, co-founder of Enchanted AI, nicknamed "AI Barbie" (she says, “I’m leaning into the free branding”).  
  - Expertise journey: Started with prompt engineering, moved to platform design, UI/UX, and now full-stack development. She notes, “I learned almost all of this with AI, barely had sessions with humans.”  
- **Her Goal**  
  - To help people and businesses level up their skills and become the "go-to AI person" in their workplace.  
  - Real example: “My biggest compliment is when a client calls and says, ‘I’ve figured it out, I don’t need you anymore.’”  
- **Projects**  
  - **Bertie**: A white-label AI platform they’ve been working on for 9 months, customizable for experts to blend their skills with AI. Nadia says, “It’s like giving birth, this baby needs to come out!”  
  - Access: Shared a trial link during the session, with a warning: “They’ll take your email and spam you with Bertie stuff!”  

### Tools Introduced
- **Pitch Perfect**  
  - **Purpose**: Helps craft a strong pitch tailored to a specific audience (networking, job interviews, consulting).  
  - **How it Works**: Asks 5 questions, the last being “Who is this pitch for?” and shapes it accordingly.  
  - **Example**: Nadia says, “You wouldn’t introduce yourself to Brenda down the road playing with kids the same way you would to a big company.”  
  - **Features**: Adjustable—e.g., “Make it more professional” or “more casual.”  
- **Prompt Perfect**  
  - **Purpose**: A workflow (not a chatbot) that reframes your query into 4 frameworks for better AI results.  
  - **Frameworks**:  
    1. **5 Whys**: Why do you want this? (e.g., “Why write a LinkedIn article?”)  
    2. **Different Perspectives**: Hypothetical expert opinions (e.g., a materials researcher, a 25-year veteran manager, a sustainability consultant, a robotics entrepreneur).  
    3. **Opposite Day**: Imagine sabotaging it, then reverse it (e.g., “10 ways to ruin your LinkedIn cred”).  
    4. **Lead Magnet**: Creates a prompt bank to attract clients.  
  - **Real Example**: For Oladipo (mechanical engineer) wanting a LinkedIn article:  
    - Perspectives: “10 ideas from a materials researcher, an automotive manager, a sustainability consultant, a robotics entrepreneur.”  
    - Opposite Day: “10 ways a mechanical engineer could write a terrible article, then the opposite.”  
  - **Tip**: “Not every framework fits every task—read and pick.”  
  - **Access**: Enchanted AI website, Offers section, requires name and email.  
- **Whisperflow**  
  - **Purpose**: Converts speech to text with high accuracy, even with accents. Nadia: “I tested it with my African accent, it’s great.”  
  - **Example**: “Last week I dictated 40,000 words. Mina, who handwrote a 30,000-word dissertation, could’ve used this!”  
  - **Scenario**: “I’ve struggled with SOPs for a week—give me a step-by-step plan that’s faster and my team gets.”  
- **Bertie**  
  - **Description**: An AI platform for experts to make their skills “magical” with AI.  
  - **Status**: Near launch, trial access given tonight.  

### Key Insights on Using AI
- **Advantages**  
  - **Learning**: “Anyone can master AI with time and effort. Two years ago, I knew nothing; now I teach others.”  
  - **Opportunity**: “The AI market isn’t flooded—you can become an expert fast.”  
  - **Example**: “Go from AI Curious to AI Awesome.”  
- **Limitations**  
  - **Risks**: “Misuse (e.g., bad LinkedIn automation) can destroy your credibility.”  
  - **No-Go Areas**: “Don’t learn surgery or dentistry with AI—trouble awaits!”  
  - **Warning**: “70% of my job is telling people where *not* to use AI.”  
- **AI Detection Tools**  
  - **Inaccuracy**: Mina: “I handwrote my dissertation, typed it, and detectors said it’s AI! Paper was my proof.”  
  - **Nadia**: “It’s about results, not whether it’s AI. A copywriter’s work was flagged as AI, but she never used it.”  
  - **Issue**: “Detectors are tuned to specific models—one catches Claude, another DeepSeek.”  
  - **Hack**: “If it sounds AI-ish, cut words like ‘realm’ unless it’s sci-fi.”  

### Job Search Strategies
- **Content Strategy**  
  - **Content Pillars**: Use Prompt Perfect to build content that makes you an authority in your field.  
  - **Advice**: “Write LinkedIn articles and posts + 1 daily video. Do this for 1-2 months, and I’d be shocked if you don’t land a great job.”  
  - **Real Example**: “Someone got a C-Suite role in aviation—not creative, not a problem-solver—just spent 1 hour daily on LinkedIn, 2-3 articles weekly, and videos.”  
- **Key Note**  
  - “Don’t use AI for personal messages (e.g., to recruiters)—even if it sounds human, it feels off.”  
- **Tricks**  
  - “Create content that pops up in recruiters’ searches. In fields like mechanical engineering, competition’s low—you can stand out fast.”  
  - “Get ideas from AI, rewrite in your voice (e.g., ‘I’ve worked 8 years in HR and love it’), then tell AI to just improve flow.”  

### Q&A Section
- **Losechukwu: How do I leave my fingerprint so it doesn’t seem AI-generated?**  
  - **Nadia**: “A veteran copywriter’s work was flagged as AI, but she never used it. If it’s good and doesn’t annoy readers, it doesn’t matter. You’re in charge—read it and ask, ‘Would I write this?’”  
  - **Trick**: “Take AI ideas, rewrite in your tone (e.g., ‘I’ve been in HR 8 years and enjoy it’), tell AI to only tweak flow, not voice.”  
  - **Mina**: “Detectors aren’t reliable—I handwrote my dissertation, and they said AI! Paper proved me right.”  
- **Syed: What’s next after summarizing with Perplexity?**  
  - **Nadia**: “Ask if it’s a hallucination, then request data links to verify.”  
- **Oladipo: How can I use AI better for job hunting in mechanical engineering? What about resumes and cover letters?**  
  - **Nadia**:  
    1. “In Prompt Perfect, say: ‘I want to seem eager and experienced—how do I reach my next career level?’ You’ll get 4 prompts—test them all.”  
    2. “Be honest: ‘I can’t reach the right people, I’m frustrated—how do I get my dream job?’”  
    3. “Key: ‘I’m a mechanical engineer with a master’s—give me content pillars to become an authority.’ Run the expert perspectives framework in ChatGPT.”  
    4. “Do LinkedIn articles, posts, + 1 daily video for 1-2 months.”  
    - **Resumes & Cover Letters**: “Use Prompt Perfect: ‘Give me a resume and cover letter that’s eager, professional, and shows my experience.’ Then rewrite in your voice, let AI refine structure only.”  
    - **Example**: “I used ChatGPT for job searches, got repetitive results. Nadia said try Gemini, Perplexity—find what fits.”  
    - **Warning**: “Don’t AI-write LinkedIn messages—it feels fake.”  
    - **Offer**: “Book a free 30-min session with me—link’s in the chat—I’ll unpack everything.”  
  - **Mina**: “Creating content is key—shift from user to creator.”  
  - **Nadia**: “In mechanical engineering, there’s less competition—you can become a go-to expert fast.”  

### Practical Tips
- **Tools**: ChatGPT, Gemini (great for coding), Claude, Perplexity, DeepSeek, O3 Mini High (beats 4.5). “Test them all.”  
- **Consulting**: “Book 30 mins free with me—I’ll give you everything I know. If you succeed, just refer me.”  
- **Mindset**: “AI’s like cars in the 1900s—it’s here to stay. No one’s truly an expert—it takes 10,000 hours.”  

### Miscellaneous
- **Session**: Recorded, will be on YouTube and LinkedIn (link in chat).  
- **Humor**: “If you’re crying at work, eat Nigerian food and blame the spice!” (Joking with Oladipo, who’s Nigerian).
